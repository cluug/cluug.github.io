	<h1>Welcome to CLUG!</h1>
	This is the website for the Clemson Linux User Group.  It will eventually
	look better than this.
	<br><br>
	The next meeting will be on Thursday, September 25th from 5:30-6:15 PM in
	McAdams 110B.
	<br><br>
	If you don't like the recurring meeting day/time (Thursdays at 5:30 PM) for
	whatever reason, let us know your availability
	<a href="https://whenisgood.net/539nzfn">here</a>
	and we'll see if there is a day/time that works better for everyone.
